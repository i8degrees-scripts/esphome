# [1]: IMPORTANT(JEFF): Avoid the potential scenario where lack 
# of comms with this component invokes an automatic restart of 
# the device node. This is by design and is intended to act as
# an aid in automatic comms "healing".
#
# This particular smart plug serves a mission critical purpose
# and is presently immune to the above "patching" only because
# of the relay switch's restore_mode attribute being always on.
# If this were to change inadvertedly, this patch is the only
# other failsafe to not bringing our home Internet connection 
# down every 15 minutes or so...
